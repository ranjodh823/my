I learnt the core values of focus, perseverance and patience at a very early stage of my life. My father who is a patient, disciplined and determined individual, would spend countless number of hours in his endeavor to purchase a residential property in nascent economic times. His success in buying our dream home and at a “value-for-money” motivated me to follow his ideals</p>
A few years later, it was this belief that led me to major success in organizing a cultural event in our sprawling locality. After convincing nearly 10 of my friends staying nearby, I went on to solve problems in the other two areas of concern – lack of funds and unwillingness of the community towards contributing to the event. Beyond the schooling and study hours, I led the team towards garnering contributions from more than 100 households in the locality. Slowly and gradually, and over a 2 month period, we had crossed our targeted revenue collection. The event was a mega-success and established the trend for similar cohesive celebrations and the foundation for the “Cultural events committee” in the residential complex.</p>
I realized my passion for Technology during the final year of my undergraduation. A particular project required me to develop computer software to automate certain calculations and tasks that formed a part of an experiment. My intellect gained apt stimulation as I developed the “logic flow”, wrote programming instructions and tested the software (computer application). After completing my Graduation in Computer Sciences, I was eager to join a cutting-edge technology company and make a mark as a professional in this booming, dynamic industry.</p>
At ABC (my first employer), I had the opportunity to work with “Bluetooth”, an emerging technology. Valuable skills in teamwork were learnt as we were expected to wear different hats at the same time in the technology start-up – we had to help not just ourselves but each other. Apart from technology, I played a key role in the quality assurance team and was instrumental in getting ISO 9001:2000 for my organization. The project brought home the importance of processes in the IT (1) industry. I also became aware of the process of designing systems to ensure continual improvement. After a brief stint in developing open source software applications at ABC, I joined DEF , an established name in the industry and in The Silicon Valley itself! In the initial first month itself I realized that the rich cultural diversity – my colleagues at ADEF Inc. happened to be from all across the continents. The tenure broadened my perspective through exposure to a variety of cultures and languages and fortified competencies as a software engineer.</p>
The transition to DEF marked a new step-up in my career. As a team leader, I was entrusted with the responsibility of large-scale leading teams and on sophisticated, intriguing and challenging technology projects involving understanding of computer technology at a much deeper level (operating systems, databases). I also became acquainted with the entire life-cycle of technology product development and had the opportunity to interface with clients across the globe and assess their needs. My career has thus evolved from that of an engineer/technologist to a professional capable of understanding both technological and business developments and leading technical teams to deliver outstanding project results.</p>
The IT (Information Technology) industry forms the focus of my near-term (post-MBA) and long-term goals. With strong depth, expertise and leadership experience in the IT industry, my near-term goal is to higher levels of responsibilities and challenges as a Project Manager. With core competencies in actuating the development of software products, I hope to add value to the technology/product strategy/deployments of leading IT (1) corporations such as A, B , C and D. I also hope to gain further depth of expertise by working with software services corporations such as EFG. In the long run, I aim towards heading the IT (1) function/department whose core business may not be technology. Such a role will enable me to passionately succeed in applying technology towards making business easy.</p>
A global MBA from XYZ university is the key to achieving my career goals at this juncture in my career. It will enable understanding at a cross-functional level of enterprise complexity and at a perfect stage to be able to apply such learning’s. I will thus be aware and well-conversant with the challenges faced by various business functions – be it Information Systems, finance, operations, sales and marketing or human resources. Such an educational endeavor will complement my core competencies as a technologist and equip me to utilize my knowledge and expertise towards building world-class computer applications that will solve a variety of business challenges and enable my clients to create value. The School’s approach of cultivating intuition through academic coursework, case studies and consulting and research assignments will help me strengthen my fundamentals and develop well-trained managerial and entrepreneurial instincts in my chosen field. I also hope to equip myself with advanced analytical tools and techniques that will foster managerial efficiency.</p>
The XYZ College of Business with a rich accomplishment history ranks among the premier, truly global business schools. Such a platform to interact with globally diverse student community will bring in the opportunity to learn cutting-edge business practices and will also prepare me to excel in a global arena. There is also the great opportunity to closely network with alumni and learn through seminars from global business leaders. It is thus my most preferred destination for pursing an M.B.A program.</p>



From my past experience working as a Planning Engineer in Hydel & Nuclear Projects in L&T,
I realized that technical and management aspects of life are cross functional and are
conjoint entities and only strong technical background synergistically with good project
management skills, is the success mantra to climb up the ladder to the top in the corporate world -
And this ismy goal.My first step in the pursuit of my goal was to join Thapar Institute of
Engineering andTechnology, which has given me a good technical grounding and a problem
solving ability. As a Class Representative at school level, Member Student Consultative
Committee at college level ora Finance Convener of an event held at college, I have always
demonstrated innate leadership capabilities. It’s the time to put another step forward and therefore
management education wouldbe a vital aid in achieving for my goal. I believe this would help
me working as a ProjectManager / Leader after my MBA.FMS is known to attract some of the
best talent in its student and faculty and has a history of producing world-class business leaders
for the past 50 years. FMS is also reputed to have a very rigorous academic program with
innovative teaching methodology and coupled with its excellent industrial & academic
associations as well as a strong alumni network is an ideal starting point of my journey. I have a
passion for learning and believe that I will grow in such an exemplary environment.



My career goal is to own a technology driven firm down the line ten to
fifteen years. This can be achieved only by having a good understanding of business
fundamentals and its execution.
I have been living away from my home for higher education, with my friends, right after
completing my matriculation, and it has helped me to develop the sense of teamwork and
recognition of others. Being a part of NCC in school, cricket and musical teams (I play Tabla) of
my school, college and my organization has helped me understand and appreciate the concept of
people working together towards the same goal. I am now working for more than 5.5 years in IT
industry. Currently I am working in an organization, which believes and works with global
teams. It has given me the skill of being flexible and better communication and good
coordination. All these, along with a good academic record and technical expertise give me an
upper hand to think of getting into software enterprise management course.
As Cisco Systems India team is expanding very fast now, I am slowly getting involved more into
managerial activities of coordinating with global teams, resource management, working with
“product line management” on defining requirements and understanding customer needs. I see
this as the first step towards my ultimate goal of owning a technology firm. Hence, I would like
to formalize my training and to learn necessary management skills. I believe that a management
course will help me transition myself from “managing small technical team” to a business leader
with a sound understanding of business goals and market dynamics.



Life may be a journey which may be a mixed tale of blissfulness and sorrow. To take this excellent journey of life, every individual has got to manage the numerous aspects uniquely and therefore the one who learns the act of managing, handling, directing and controlling various resources during his life within the absolute best way only comes bent be victorious.

The process of learning continues throughout once life says an old adage. As one goes on learning new things, one realizes that there are many more things which one needs to learn to quench one’s thirst for knowledge. During the course of my undergraduate study I have learnt many things but I have also realized that I need to learn more to advance frontiers in my field of interest. A graduate study is the next step in my quest for knowledge and to bring out my forte to the fore.
 
  Right from my school days, I have always shown a high degree of competence and interest in mathematics and physical sciences. It was with this motivation that I took up the mathematics and physical sciences stream in my pre-university course. My excellent performance here gave me the confidence to take electronics and communication engineering. I was admitted to the undergraduate program in electronics and communication through a statewide entrance examination in mathematics and physical sciences. In my undergraduate study I have been deeply interested by subjects such as semiconductor electronics, Digital signal processing, Stochastic Processes and Digital Communications. I have furthered my knowledge in these subjects; especially signal processing through extensive reading. I closely follow the latest research through journals and publications of transactions and proceedings by IEEE and other prominent professional societies. In fact, I feel that this extensive reading has been influential in shaping my interests and attitude.
     
My area of interest is Communications and Signal Processing. Signal processing, in its theory and application, is reflective of man’s inherent nature to challenge the obvious and seek to discover the unreachable. I have been attracted to the subject due to its highly mathematical approach and because of its objective of extracting the maximum information from unwieldy signals. In addition to reading and working with the excellent literature available on this subject, I have also used Mat lab extensively to strengthen my theoretical concepts. Statistical and adaptive techniques in signal processing have brought about many innovations in the fields of communications, networking, computer vision, dynamic modeling, neural engineering and many others. Such advanced techniques have enormously increased the speed and capacity of communication systems and decreased the computational complexity of the solutions to many problems faced in these fields. I am highly motivated to work for developing such statistical and adaptive techniques. As an undergraduate student I am not content with what I have learnt in this subject and am thirsty for acquiring more knowledge in terms of both theory and application
 
To keep pace with fast growing technology, I attended every workshop and paper presentation competitions that were held at our college. Through them I could improve and gain knowledge in areas that were new to me. I visited National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), Hyderabad as a part of industrial visit. There I had the opportunity to see how the earth station receives digital data from the satellite and how the data is processed and stored. I also visited Elico, Hyderabad, an industry that deals with production of basic circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, etc. I could examine some of the automated machines that are used in production and also examined various techniques of testing. An industrial visit to Tibcon Capacitors, Hyderabad made me aware of the modern techniques of producing capacitors for industrial and household purposes. I was a part of the IEEE Student Branch of my college. The branch provided me many opportunities to attend technical workshops and seminars conducted by eminent personalities. Apart from this I have also been the active participant in the sports events such as Cricket, Badminton and table Tennis of my college as well as other intercollegiate competitions. All these activities have given me the confidence and inspiration to actively participate in the process of acquiring and sharing knowledge.
 
                     The essence of university education lies in the success of the symbolic relationship between the student and his department. It is with this in mind that I am looking forward to a long and rewarding relationship with your university. From the tremendous research options available here, I am confident that I will have the opportunity to work professionally with faculty on research projects and at the same time, I can make my research-work more meaningful.
 
Based on my abilities and interests I feel that pursuing a graduate program at your prestigious university would benefit me greatly in the pursuit of my dreams and goals. I have surveyed the research going on in your university and have been very impressed by the work being done by the excellent faculty at your institution. I feel I am confident enough to do justice to these aspirations and leave up to your expectations. Hoping with a positive attitude, I earnestly look forward to be a part of your esteemed institution.
